Online question and answer forums such as Stack Exchange and Quora are becoming an increasingly popular resource for education. Central to the functionality of many of these forums is the notion of tagging, whereby a user labels his/her post with an appropriate set of topics that describe the post, such that it is more easily retrieved and organized. In our project we want to predict the topic label for the test data set based up on the trends we obtain from the training dada set and then calculate the accuracy of the prediction. We implemented Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier for the prediction of class labels. Our project achieved a decent accuracy for the test data set prediction.
